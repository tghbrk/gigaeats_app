## Implementation Notes

### Navigation Fix Details:
- **Root Cause**: Route conflict between shared `/order-details/:orderId` and vendor sub-route

- **Design**: Material Design 3 compliant with existing order details theming
- **Data Source**: Uses existing Order model fields without database changes
- **Fallback**: Graceful handling of null/empty payment method data
- **Icons**: Contextual icons based on payment method type
- **Status**: Color-coded badges for visual payment status identification

### Debug Logging:
- **Navigation**: Comprehensive route tracking and error reporting
- **Payment**: Detailed payment method parsing and display logging
- **State Management**: Widget lifecycle and state change tracking
- **Error Handling**: Detailed error reporting with stack traces

## Testing Verification
