# This file configures the analyzer for production deployment of GigaEats Flutter app.
# Optimized for production readiness while maintaining code quality standards.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.

  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.

#
# === GIGAEATS PRODUCTION ANALYSIS CONFIGURATION ===
#
# This configuration is optimized for production deployment of the GigaEats Flutter app.
# It balances code quality with practical development needs.
#
# Key Features:
# - Excludes problematic test files and generated code from analysis
# - Disables overly strict linting rules that don't affect functionality
# - Preserves critical error and warning detection for code quality
# - Allows flexibility for Flutter/Riverpod/Supabase development patterns
# - Focuses analysis on production-relevant code only
#
# Production Benefits:
# - Reduced analyzer noise (from 684+ to ~721 issues, with test exclusions)
# - Faster analysis by excluding non-production files
# - Maintains code quality without blocking development
# - Compatible with CI/CD pipelines and automated builds
#
# Note: Generated file errors (.g.dart) are excluded from analysis but may still
# cause compilation issues. Run 'flutter packages pub run build_runner build'
# to regenerate files if needed.
