## üîç Current System Analysis

### **Existing Strengths**
- ‚úÖ **Driver Workflow**: Fully functional across all 7 steps (assigned‚ÜíonRouteToVendor‚ÜíarrivedAtVendor‚ÜípickedUp‚ÜíonRouteToCustomer‚ÜíarrivedAtCustomer‚Üídelivered)
- ‚úÖ **Location Tracking**: Real-time GPS updates every 15 seconds with Supabase integration
- ‚úÖ **State Management**: Robust Riverpod provider architecture with real-time subscriptions
- ‚úÖ **External Navigation**: Working Google Maps/Waze deep linking integration
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Solid foundation with orders, drivers, and delivery tracking tables

### **Critical Gaps Identified**
- ‚ùå **External App Dependency**: Drivers must switch between GigaEats and navigation apps
