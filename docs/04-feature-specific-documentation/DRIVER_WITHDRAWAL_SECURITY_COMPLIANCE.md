## üîç Fraud Detection System

### Multi-Factor Risk Assessment

#### Risk Factors Analyzed:
1. **High Amount Threshold**: Transactions ‚â• RM 1,000
2. **Rapid Withdrawal Attempts**: Multiple requests within short timeframes
3. **Unusual Time Patterns**: Transactions outside normal hours (6 AM - 10 PM)
4. **IP Address Analysis**: VPN/proxy detection, geographical risk assessment
5. **Device Fingerprinting**: New device detection, security concern identification
6. **Velocity Checks**: High-frequency transaction pattern detection

#### Risk Scoring:
- **Low Risk**: Score < 40 - Normal processing
- **Medium Risk**: Score 40-69 - Enhanced monitoring
- **High Risk**: Score ‚â• 70 - Manual review required

### Fraud Detection Thresholds:
```dart
const FRAUD_DETECTION_CONFIG = {
  HIGH_AMOUNT_THRESHOLD: 1000.00, // RM 1000
  RAPID_REQUESTS_THRESHOLD: 3, // 3 requests in short time
  RAPID_REQUESTS_WINDOW: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  VELOCITY_CHECK_WINDOW: 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 24 hours
  MAX_DAILY_REQUESTS: 5,
}
```

## üîê Data Encryption

### Encryption Standards
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM
- **Key Management**: Driver-specific keys stored in Flutter Secure Storage
- **Key Length**: 256 bits (32 bytes)
- **IV Length**: 96 bits (12 bytes) for GCM mode
- **Salt Length**: 128 bits (16 bytes)

### Encryption Process:
1. Generate or retrieve driver-specific encryption key
2. Generate random IV for each encryption operation
3. Encrypt data using AES-256-GCM
4. Combine IV + encrypted data
5. Encode to base64 for storage
6. Log encryption event for audit trail

### Key Management:
- **Key Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Key Storage**: Flutter Secure Storage with platform-specific security
- **Key Rotation**: Periodic key rotation for enhanced security
- **Key Deletion**: Secure key deletion when no longer needed

## üìä Audit & Monitoring

### Comprehensive Audit Trail

#### Events Logged:
- **Withdrawal Request Creation**: Complete request details with masked sensitive data
- **Compliance Validation**: Validation results, violations, warnings
- **Fraud Detection**: Risk assessments, fraud reasons, risk scores
- **Security Violations**: Violation types, descriptions, severity levels
- **Data Encryption/Decryption**: Encryption operations, success/failure
- **Access Control**: Access attempts, permissions, denials

#### Audit Data Retention:
- **Financial Records**: 7 years (regulatory requirement)
- **Security Events**: 5 years
- **Audit Logs**: Immutable, tamper-evident storage
- **External Logging**: Critical events logged to external SIEM systems

### Security Metrics:
- Total security events
- Critical security incidents
- Compliance violations
- Fraud detection alerts
- Encryption operation success rates
- Access control violations

## üö® Security Incident Response

### Incident Classification:
- **Low Severity**: Routine security events, successful operations
- **Medium Severity**: Warnings, medium-risk fraud detection
- **High Severity**: Security violations, high-risk fraud, system errors

### Response Procedures:
1. **Immediate Logging**: All incidents logged to audit trail
2. **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and classification
3. **Alert Generation**: High-severity incidents trigger immediate alerts
4. **Manual Review**: High-risk transactions require manual approval
5. **External Notification**: Critical incidents reported to external systems
