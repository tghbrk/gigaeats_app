# GigaEats Phase 2 Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Phase 2 Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing core app functionality with Firebase Auth integration while staying on the Spark (free) plan. We've successfully implemented a hybrid approach using Firebase for authentication and Supabase for data management with role-based access control.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### 1. **Firebase Auth Integration (Spark Plan Compatible)**
- ✅ Email/Password authentication
- ✅ Phone verification for Malaysian numbers (+60)
- ✅ User registration and login flows
- ✅ Password reset functionality
- ✅ Email verification

### 2. **Hybrid Role Management System**
- ✅ Firebase Auth for authentication
- ✅ Supabase for role storage and management
- ✅ Role-based navigation and access control
- ✅ Temporary workaround for custom claims (until Blaze upgrade)

### 3. **Local Development Environment**
- ✅ Local Supabase instance running
- ✅ Database with comprehensive schema
- ✅ RLS policies for data security
- ✅ Seed data for testing
- ✅ Storage buckets with proper permissions

### 4. **Flutter App Features**
- ✅ Authentication screens (Login/Register)
- ✅ Role-based dashboard routing
- ✅ State management with Riverpod
- ✅ Error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Testing utilities and debug features

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User registers/logs in via Firebase Auth
2. Firebase user data synced to Supabase
3. User role stored in Supabase users table
4. Role-based navigation and permissions
5. Supabase RLS policies validate Firebase JWT
```

### Role Management (Temporary Approach)
```
Firebase Auth (Authentication) + Supabase (Role Storage)
├── Registration: Role set in Supabase during signup
├── Login: Role fetched from Supabase after auth
├── Permissions: Checked via Supabase queries
└── Future: Migrate to Firebase Custom Claims (Blaze plan)
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Implementation

### 1. **Test Authentication Flow**

The app is now running on your emulator. Here's how to test:

#### Create Test Account:
1. Open the app (should show login screen)
2. Click "Create Test User" button
3. This creates: `test@gigaeats.com` / `Test123!`
4. Try logging in with these credentials

#### Test Registration:
1. Click "Sign Up" to go to registration
2. Fill in the form with a new email
3. Select a role (Sales Agent, Vendor, Admin)
4. Complete registration and verify email flow

#### Test Phone Verification:
1. During registration, enter Malaysian phone number
2. Format: `+60123456789` or `0123456789`
3. Test SMS verification flow

### 2. **Test Role-Based Navigation**

After successful login, users should be redirected based on their role:
- **Admin**: Admin Dashboard
- **Sales Agent**: Sales Agent Dashboard  
- **Vendor**: Vendor Dashboard

### 3. **Test Supabase Integration**

#### Check Database:
1. Open Supabase Studio: http://127.0.0.1:54323
2. Go to Table Editor
3. Check `users` table for new registrations
4. Verify role assignments

#### Test RLS Policies:
1. Register users with different roles
2. Verify they can only access their own data
3. Check that Firebase JWT is properly validated

## 📱 Available Features by Role

### **Admin Dashboard**
- User management
- System overview
- Analytics and reports
- Vendor approval/verification

### **Sales Agent Dashboard**
- Customer management
- Order creation and tracking
- Vendor catalog browsing
- Commission tracking

### **Vendor Dashboard**
- Menu item management
- Order management
- Business profile settings
- Analytics and insights

## 🔍 Debugging and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. **Firebase Connection Issues**
- Use "Test Connection" button on login screen
- Check Firebase console for project status
- Verify `firebase_options.dart` is correct

#### 2. **Supabase Connection Issues**
- Ensure local Supabase is running: `supabase status`
- Check logs: `supabase logs`
- Verify config in `lib/core/config/supabase_config.dart`

#### 3. **Authentication Failures**
- Check Firebase Auth console for user creation
- Verify email verification settings
- Check Supabase users table for sync issues

#### 4. **Role Assignment Issues**
- Check Supabase users table for role field
- Verify AuthSyncService is working
- Check debug logs in Flutter console

### Debug Commands:
```bash
# Check Supabase status
supabase status

# View Supabase logs
supabase logs

# Flutter logs
flutter logs

# Hot reload
r (in Flutter terminal)
```

## 🚀 Next Development Steps

### Immediate (Phase 2 Continuation):
1. **Implement Core Features**:
