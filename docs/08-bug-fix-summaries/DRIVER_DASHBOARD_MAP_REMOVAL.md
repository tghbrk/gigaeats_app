# Driver Dashboard Map Feature Removal

## Summary

The Google Maps integration has been removed from the GigaEats driver dashboard interface as it currently didn't serve a functional purpose in the driver workflow.

## Changes Made

### 1. Driver Dashboard Updates
- **File**: `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/screens/driver_dashboard.dart`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed Map tab from bottom navigation
  - Updated navigation destinations from 5 tabs to 4 tabs
  - Removed import for `driver_map_screen.dart`
  - Updated IndexedStack to exclude DriverMapScreen

### 2. File Deletions
- **Deleted**: `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/screens/driver_map_screen.dart`
- **Deleted**: `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/providers/driver_map_provider.dart`
- These files were only used for the dashboard map display functionality

### 3. Dependencies Cleanup
- No unused dependencies were found that needed removal
- All Google Maps and location-related dependencies are still needed for navigation features
- Preserved dependencies: `geolocator`, `geocoding`, `google_maps_flutter`, `flutter_tts`, `google_polyline_algorithm`

### 4. Documentation Updates
- **Updated**: `docs/06-setup-deployment-guides/GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md`
  - Removed references to dashboard map testing
  - Updated feature descriptions to focus on navigation functionality
  - Added note about dashboard map removal
- **Updated**: `docs/04-feature-specific-documentation/DRIVER_DASHBOARD_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`
  - Added note about map tab removal
- **Added**: Code comments in driver dashboard file explaining the removal

## Preserved Navigation Features

The following map and navigation features are **preserved** and continue to function:

### In-App Navigation
- Full-screen turn-by-turn navigation during delivery (`in_app_navigation_screen.dart`)
- Route preview with distance and ETA (`pre_navigation_overview_screen.dart`)
- Voice guidance and traffic integration
- Multi-waypoint navigation for batch deliveries

### External Navigation Integration
- Google Maps, Waze, and other navigation app integration
- Deep linking for navigation apps
- Navigation method selection dialogs

### Location Services
- Real-time driver location tracking during deliveries
- GPS-based order tracking for customers
- Location permissions for delivery workflow
- Geofencing and proximity detection

## Future Considerations

The map feature will be re-implemented later with a different purpose:
- **Planned Feature**: Visual distance representation for checking nearby orders
- **Use Case**: Help drivers see available orders in their vicinity
- **Implementation**: Will be added as a new feature when the nearby orders functionality is developed

## Testing Requirements

- ✅ Driver dashboard loads correctly without map component
- ✅ No map-related errors in console logs
- ✅ Navigation features in driver workflow still function properly
- ✅ All 4 remaining tabs (Dashboard, Orders, Earnings, Profile) work correctly
- ✅ Bottom navigation indices are properly adjusted

## Files Modified

### Modified Files
- `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/screens/driver_dashboard.dart`
- `docs/06-setup-deployment-guides/GOOGLE_MAPS_SETUP.md`
- `docs/04-feature-specific-documentation/DRIVER_DASHBOARD_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md`

### Deleted Files
- `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/screens/driver_map_screen.dart`
- `lib/src/features/drivers/presentation/providers/driver_map_provider.dart`

### Created Files
- `docs/08-bug-fix-summaries/DRIVER_DASHBOARD_MAP_REMOVAL.md` (this file)

## Impact Assessment

- **Positive**: Simplified driver dashboard interface
- **Positive**: Removed unused code and reduced complexity
- **Neutral**: No functional impact on driver workflow
- **Future**: Map feature can be re-added with proper purpose when needed

## Related Issues

This change addresses the requirement to remove non-functional UI elements and focus the driver dashboard on essential features: order management, earnings tracking, and profile management.
