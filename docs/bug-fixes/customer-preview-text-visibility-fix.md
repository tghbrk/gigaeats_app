# Customer Preview Text Visibility Fix

## Issue Summary
Fixed text visibility issues in the customer preview component where the "Customer Preview" title and related text elements had poor contrast and were barely visible to users.

## Problem Details
- **Location**: `lib/src/features/menu/presentation/widgets/vendor/customer_preview_component.dart`
- **Issue**: "Customer Preview" text highlighted in red with very poor contrast
- **Root Cause**: Text was using `theme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant` which provided insufficient contrast
- **User Impact**: Critical interface text was nearly invisible, affecting usability

## Visual Evidence
The issue was identified through user screenshot showing red-highlighted text indicating poor visibility in the customer preview section of the template management interface.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Primary Issue**: "Customer Preview" title used `onSurfaceVariant` color
2. **Secondary Issues**: Description text and base price text also had poor contrast
3. **Theme Problem**: `onSurfaceVariant` is designed for subtle text but was used for important headings
4. **Accessibility**: Failed to meet minimum contrast ratio requirements

## Solution Applied

### 1. Customer Preview Title Enhancement
```dart
// Before - Poor contrast
Text(
  'Customer Preview',
  style: theme.textTheme.titleMedium?.copyWith(
    color: theme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant, // Too light
  ),
),

// After - Proper contrast and emphasis
Text(
  'Customer Preview',
  style: theme.textTheme.titleMedium?.copyWith(
    color: theme.colorScheme.onSurface, // High contrast
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600, // Added emphasis
  ),
),
```

### 2. Description Text Improvement
```dart
// Before - Barely visible
style: theme.textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant,
),

// After - Better visibility
style: theme.textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurface.withValues(alpha: 0.8),
),
```

### 3. Base Price Text Enhancement
```dart
// Before - Poor contrast
style: theme.textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant,
),

// After - Improved readability
style: theme.textTheme.bodyMedium?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurface.withValues(alpha: 0.8),
),
```

### 4. Template Description Text Fix
```dart
// Before - Too faint
style: theme.textTheme.bodySmall?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurfaceVariant,
),

// After - Better contrast
style: theme.textTheme.bodySmall?.copyWith(
  color: theme.colorScheme.onSurface.withValues(alpha: 0.7),
),
```
