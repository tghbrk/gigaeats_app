### Debug Logging Verification
Expected log entries:
```
üí∞ [DELIVERY-PICKER] Calculating delivery fees for all methods
‚úÖ [DELIVERY-PICKER] Fee calculated for customer_pickup: Free
‚úÖ [DELIVERY-PICKER] Fee calculated for own_fleet: RM10.00
üìä [DELIVERY-PICKER] customer_pickup: Free
üìä [DELIVERY-PICKER] delivery: RM10.00
üöö [DELIVERY-PICKER] Selected delivery method: customer_pickup
üí∞ [DELIVERY-PICKER] Selected method pricing: Free
```

### Android Emulator Testing
1. **Hot Restart Test**: Verify pricing persists after hot restart
2. **Method Switching**: Test rapid switching between delivery methods
3. **Parameter Updates**: Change address and verify pricing updates
4. **Performance**: Ensure smooth UI with no lag during calculations

### **Immediate Testing Steps**
1. **Navigate to Cart**: Open customer cart screen (My Cart)
2. **Verify Enhanced Picker**: Confirm delivery method cards show pricing containers
3. **Check Pricing Display**:
   - Customer Pickup should show "FREE" in green container
   - Delivery should show calculated fee (e.g., "RM 10.00") in blue container
   - Scheduled Delivery should show same pricing as delivery
4. **Test Debug Logs**: Check for initialization and calculation logs
5. **Method Selection**: Select different methods and verify pricing updates

## üîÑ **Integration Points**

### Existing Components
- **DeliveryFeeService**: Uses existing service for fee calculations
- **DeliveryFeeCalculation**: Leverages existing calculation models
- **CustomerDeliveryMethod**: Works with existing delivery method enum
- **Material Design 3**: Follows existing design system

### Provider Integration
- Compatible with existing `deliveryFeeServiceProvider`
- Works alongside `DeliveryPricingProvider` from delivery summary
- Maintains consistency with cart summary pricing displays

## üì± **User Experience Improvements**

### Before Enhancement
- Pricing only visible in delivery summary after method selection
- No immediate feedback on delivery costs
- Required navigation to see pricing breakdown

### After Enhancement
- **Immediate Visibility**: Pricing shown for all methods upfront
- **Informed Decisions**: Customers can compare costs before selecting
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear distinction between free and paid options
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic pricing based on current parameters

## üöÄ **Performance Optimizations**

1. **Efficient Calculations**: Pickup methods skip API calls
2. **Smart Updates**: Only recalculate when parameters actually change
3. **Caching**: Calculation results cached until parameters change
4. **Async Operations**: Non-blocking UI during fee calculations

## üîç **Root Cause Analysis & Fix**

### **Issue Identified**
The delivery method pricing enhancement was not visible because the **customer cart screen** was using simple `RadioListTile` widgets instead of the `EnhancedDeliveryMethodPicker`. The enhanced picker was only used in the checkout flow, not in the main cart view where users first see delivery options.

### **Solution Implemented**
1. **Replaced Simple RadioListTile**: Updated customer cart screen to use `EnhancedDeliveryMethodPicker`
2. **Fixed Enum Mapping**: Corrected `_mapToDeliveryMethod` to return proper enum values
3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the pricing flow
4. **Improved Error Handling**: Better fallback calculations and error recovery

### **Enhanced Logging**
- Widget initialization and parameter tracking
- Fee calculation progress and results
- Pricing display logic and fallbacks
- Method selection with pricing context
- Performance timing information

### **Manual Refresh**
- `refreshCalculations()` method for testing
- Force recalculation capability
- Debug state inspection

## üìã **Implementation Files Modified**

1. **enhanced_delivery_method_picker.dart**
   - Fixed enum mapping function (`_mapToDeliveryMethod`)
   - Added prominent pricing display (`_buildPricingInfo`, `_buildPriceDisplay`)
   - Enhanced visual styling with containers and colors
   - Improved error handling and comprehensive debug logging
   - Added widget initialization and parameter tracking

2. **customer_cart_screen.dart**
   - **CRITICAL FIX**: Replaced simple `RadioListTile` with `EnhancedDeliveryMethodPicker`
   - Added import for enhanced delivery method picker
   - Integrated with existing cart state management
   - Maintained compatibility with customer cart provider

## üéØ **Success Criteria Met**

‚úÖ **Pricing Display**: Each method card shows calculated delivery fee prominently  
‚úÖ **Consistent Formatting**: Uses same format as delivery summary ("FREE"/"RM X.XX")  
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: Pricing updates dynamically when parameters change  
‚úÖ **Visual Integration**: Clear positioning without cluttering existing layout  
‚úÖ **Loading States**: Shows calculation progress appropriately  
‚úÖ **Provider Integration**: Uses existing fee calculation logic effectively  

## üîÆ **Future Enhancements**

1. **Surge Pricing Indicators**: Visual indicators for peak time pricing
2. **Discount Badges**: Show promotional discounts on method cards
3. **Comparison Highlights**: Highlight best value or recommended options
4. **Accessibility**: Enhanced screen reader support for pricing information
5. **Animation**: Smooth transitions when pricing updates

## üìû **Support & Maintenance**

### Monitoring
- Debug logs provide comprehensive calculation tracking
- Error handling ensures graceful degradation
- Performance metrics available through logging

### Troubleshooting
- Check debug logs for calculation failures
