# GigaEats Design System Migration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the phased migration plan to move from existing UI components to the new GigaEats Design System (GE) components while maintaining functionality and ensuring zero downtime.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Components Identified
1. **DashboardCard** (lib/src/shared/widgets/dashboard_card.dart)
   - Used extensively in vendor and admin dashboards
   - Has 3 variants: DashboardCard, StatCard, MetricCard
   - Inconsistent styling and behavior across roles

2. **CustomButton** (lib/src/shared/widgets/custom_button.dart)
   - 4 button types: primary, secondary, outline, text
   - Used across all role interfaces
   - Lacks role-specific theming

3. **Navigation Patterns**
   - Each role has custom navigation implementation
   - Inconsistent styling and behavior
   - No unified navigation configuration

### Usage Patterns by Role

#### Customer Dashboard
- Uses custom `_buildStatCard()` method
- 2 stat cards: Total Orders, Total Spent
- Custom implementation, not using shared DashboardCard

#### Vendor Dashboard
- Heavy usage of DashboardCard (12 instances)
- 4 main metrics: Today's Revenue, Pending Orders, Total Orders, Rating
- Consistent color coding but hardcoded colors
- Loading and error states handled manually

#### Admin Dashboard
- Uses DashboardCard (4 instances)
- 4 main metrics: Total Revenue, Active Users, Total Orders, Active Vendors
- Hardcoded colors and values (appears to be placeholder data)

#### Driver Dashboard
- No current usage of dashboard cards
- Opportunity for new implementation

#### Sales Agent Dashboard
- No current usage of dashboard cards
- Opportunity for new implementation

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Migration (Week 1)
**Goal**: Establish new design system usage without breaking existing functionality

#### 1.1 Create Compatibility Layer
- Create wrapper components that map old APIs to new GE components
- Ensure backward compatibility during transition

#### 1.2 Update Theme Integration
- Integrate GE theme system into existing screens
- Test role-specific theming across all dashboards

#### 1.3 Pilot Migration - Admin Dashboard
- **Why Admin First**: Simplest implementation, placeholder data
- **Components to Migrate**:
  - 4 DashboardCard → GEDashboardCard
  - Navigation → GEBottomNavigation
  - Screen layout → GEScreen

### Phase 2: High-Impact Dashboards (Week 2)
**Goal**: Migrate the most visible and frequently used screens

#### 2.1 Vendor Dashboard Migration
- **Priority**: High (most complex dashboard usage)
- **Components to Migrate**:
  - 12 DashboardCard instances → GEDashboardCard
  - Loading states → GEDashboardCard.isLoading
  - Error handling → standardized error states
  - Color coding → role-specific theming

#### 2.2 Customer Dashboard Migration
- **Priority**: High (customer-facing)
- **Components to Migrate**:
  - Custom `_buildStatCard()` → GEDashboardCard
  - Screen layout → GEScreen.scrollable
  - Navigation → GEBottomNavigation

### Phase 3: Complete Role Coverage (Week 3)
**Goal**: Ensure all roles have consistent design system implementation

#### 3.1 Driver Dashboard Enhancement
- **Priority**: Medium (opportunity for improvement)
- **New Implementation**:
  - Add dashboard cards for driver metrics
  - Implement GEBottomNavigation with driver config
  - Use GEScreen layout

#### 3.2 Sales Agent Dashboard Enhancement
- **Priority**: Medium (opportunity for improvement)
- **New Implementation**:
  - Add dashboard cards for sales metrics
  - Implement GEBottomNavigation with sales agent config
  - Use GEScreen layout

### Phase 4: Component Standardization (Week 4)
**Goal**: Replace all remaining custom components with GE components

#### 4.1 Button Migration
- Replace all CustomButton usage with GEButton
- Update button types to match GE variants
- Apply role-specific theming

#### 4.2 Form Components
- Migrate text fields to GETextField
- Standardize form layouts with GESection
- Implement consistent validation patterns

#### 4.3 Navigation Standardization
- Replace all custom navigation with GEBottomNavigation
- Use GERoleNavigationConfig for each role
- Standardize app bars with GEAppBar

## Implementation Details

### Migration Checklist Template

For each component migration:
- [ ] Create new implementation using GE components
- [ ] Test functionality parity
- [ ] Test role-specific theming
- [ ] Test responsive behavior
- [ ] Update imports
- [ ] Remove old component usage
- [ ] Test on Android emulator
- [ ] Verify no regressions

### Risk Mitigation

1. **Backward Compatibility**
   - Keep old components until migration is complete
   - Use feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Maintain parallel implementations during transition

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Test each role's dashboard after migration
   - Verify theming works correctly
   - Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes
   - Validate accessibility features

3. **Rollback Plan**
   - Keep old component implementations
   - Use git branches for each migration phase
   - Quick rollback capability if issues arise

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] 100% of dashboard cards use GEDashboardCard
- [ ] 100% of buttons use GEButton
- [ ] 100% of navigation uses GEBottomNavigation
- [ ] 0 compilation errors
- [ ] 0 runtime errors in migrated screens

### Design Consistency Metrics
- [ ] All roles use consistent spacing (GESpacing tokens)
- [ ] All roles use consistent colors (role-specific theming)
- [ ] All roles use consistent typography (GETypography)
- [ ] All roles use consistent border radius (GEBorderRadius)

### User Experience Metrics
- [ ] Consistent interaction patterns across roles
- [ ] Proper loading states in all dashboards
- [ ] Consistent error handling
- [ ] Responsive design on all screen sizes

## Timeline Summary

| Week | Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Compatibility & Admin | GE theme integration, Admin dashboard migrated |
| 2 | High-Impact | Vendor & Customer | Main dashboards using GE components |
| 3 | Coverage | Driver & Sales Agent | All roles have consistent dashboards |
| 4 | Standardization | Buttons & Forms | Complete component migration |

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Start Phase 1 with compatibility layer
2. **Week 1**: Complete admin dashboard migration
3. **Week 2**: Begin vendor dashboard migration
4. **Ongoing**: Document lessons learned and update migration plan
