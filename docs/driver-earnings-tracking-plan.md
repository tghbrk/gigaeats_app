## Implementation Plan

### **Phase 1: Backend Validation and Enhancement (Priority: High)**

#### **Step 1.1: Verify Database Schema Implementation**
**Files to check:**
- Supabase database tables via admin panel
- Migration status verification

**Actions:**
1. Verify all earnings tables exist and are properly configured
2. Test RLS policies with different user roles
3. Validate automatic earnings recording on order completion
4. Check commission structure default values

#### **Step 1.2: Enhance Earnings Calculation Logic**
**File:** `supabase/functions/enhanced-earnings-calculation/index.ts` (new)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Edge Function for complex earnings calculations
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"
import { createClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@supabase/supabase-js@2'

interface EarningsCalculationRequest {
  orderId: string
  driverId: string
  includeBonus?: boolean
  customTip?: number
}

serve(async (req) => {
  const { orderId, driverId, includeBonus, customTip }: EarningsCalculationRequest = await req.json()
  
  const supabase = createClient(
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_URL') ?? '',
    Deno.env.get('SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY') ?? ''
  )

  // Enhanced earnings calculation with performance bonuses
  const { data: earnings, error } = await supabase.rpc('calculate_enhanced_driver_earnings', {
    p_order_id: orderId,
    p_driver_id: driverId,
    p_include_bonus: includeBonus,
    p_custom_tip: customTip
  })

  return new Response(JSON.stringify({ earnings, error }), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  })
})
```

#### **Step 1.3: Add Real-time Earnings Triggers**
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250618000001_enhanced_earnings_realtime.sql` (new)

**Implementation:**
```sql
-- Enhanced real-time earnings notifications
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION notify_earnings_update()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Notify driver of earnings update
    PERFORM pg_notify(
        'driver_earnings_' || NEW.driver_id,
        json_build_object(
            'type', 'earnings_update',
            'earnings_id', NEW.id,
            'amount', NEW.net_amount,
            'order_id', NEW.order_id,
            'status', NEW.status
        )::text
    );
    
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Create trigger for real-time notifications
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_notify_earnings_update ON driver_earnings;
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_notify_earnings_update
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON driver_earnings
    FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION notify_earnings_update();
```

  return _supabase
      .from('driver_earnings')
      .stream(primaryKey: ['id'])
      .eq('driver_id', driverId)
      .order('created_at', ascending: false)
