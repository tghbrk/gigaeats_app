# Driver Wallet Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security implementation for the GigaEats Driver Wallet System, including Row Level Security (RLS) policies, input validation, audit logging, and suspicious activity detection.

## üîí Security Components Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RLS Policies

#### Driver Wallet Access Control
- **Policy**: `driver_wallet_select_own_only`
  - Drivers can only view their own wallet
  - Requires active driver status verification
  - Validates user authentication and driver profile

- **Policy**: `driver_wallet_update_restricted`
  - Drivers can only update specific fields of their wallet
  - Prevents modification of critical fields (user_id, user_role, wallet_type, created_at)
  - Requires active driver status verification

- **Policy**: `driver_wallet_no_insert`
  - Prevents drivers from creating wallets directly
  - Only system/service role can create driver wallets
  - Ensures proper wallet creation workflow

#### Transaction Security
- **Policy**: `driver_transaction_select_own_only`
  - Drivers can only view transactions from their own wallet
  - Requires active driver status verification
  - Includes additional security checks for wallet ownership

- **Policy**: `driver_transaction_no_insert`
  - Prevents drivers from inserting transactions directly
  - Only Edge Functions (service role) can create transactions
  - Ensures transaction integrity and audit trail

- **Policy**: `driver_transaction_no_update`
  - Prevents any updates to transactions
  - Maintains immutable transaction history
  - Preserves audit trail integrity

- **Policy**: `driver_transaction_no_delete`
  - Prevents deletion of transactions
  - Ensures complete audit trail preservation
  - Maintains financial record integrity

#### Withdrawal Request Security
- **Policy**: `driver_withdrawal_select_own_only`
  - Drivers can only view their own withdrawal requests
  - Requires active driver status verification

- **Policy**: `driver_withdrawal_insert_own_only`
  - Drivers can only create withdrawal requests for themselves
  - Includes built-in validation for amount limits and withdrawal methods
  - Requires active driver status verification

- **Policy**: `driver_withdrawal_update_restricted`
  - Drivers can only update specific fields of pending withdrawal requests
  - Prevents modification of critical fields (driver_id, amount, requested_at)
  - Only allows updates to withdrawal method, bank details, and notes

### 2. Security Validation Functions

#### Enhanced Wallet Ownership Validation
```sql
validate_driver_wallet_ownership_enhanced(p_wallet_id UUID, p_user_id UUID)
```
- Validates wallet ownership with additional security checks
- Verifies driver is active and wallet is active
- Returns boolean result for access control

#### Enhanced Withdrawal Limits Validation
```sql
validate_driver_withdrawal_limits_enhanced(p_driver_id UUID, p_amount DECIMAL)
```
- Validates withdrawal amounts against multiple limits:
  - Minimum amount: RM 10.00
  - Maximum single amount: RM 5,000.00
  - Daily limit: RM 1,000.00 (configurable)
  - Weekly limit: RM 7,000.00
- Returns comprehensive validation result with remaining limits

#### Suspicious Activity Detection
```sql
detect_suspicious_withdrawal_pattern(p_driver_id UUID, p_amount DECIMAL)
```
- Detects suspicious withdrawal patterns:
  - Rapid successive withdrawals (>3 in 1 hour)
  - Multiple large withdrawals (>2 over RM 500 in 24 hours)
  - Unusual time patterns (outside 6 AM - 10 PM)
  - Unusually large amounts (>RM 2,000)
- Returns risk assessment with pattern details

### 3. Flutter Security Components

#### DriverWalletSecurityService
Comprehensive security service providing:
- **Wallet Access Validation**: Session validation, driver role verification, wallet ownership checks
- **Transaction Input Validation**: Amount validation, currency checks, transaction type validation
- **Withdrawal Input Validation**: Amount limits, withdrawal method validation, bank details verification

Security middleware providing:
- **Secure Operation Execution**: Wraps operations with security validation and audit logging
- **Input Sanitization**: Removes potentially dangerous characters and scripts
- **Financial Input Validation**: Validates amounts, currency, and decimal places
- **Rate Limiting**: Checks for excessive operation frequency
