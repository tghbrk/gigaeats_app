Future Considerations / Roadmap

1. Introduction & Core Product Overview
GigaEats is a three-sided B2B2C marketplace designed to revolutionize bulk food ordering in Malaysia. It connects Sales Agents, Food Vendors, and Bulk Food Buyers (corporates, event organizers, caterers, institutions) on a unified, efficient, and scalable platform.

Sales Agents act as intermediaries, leveraging their networks and expertise to aggregate large-volume food orders. They earn commissions from vendors for orders facilitated through the platform.

Food Vendors (restaurants, caterers, cloud kitchens, food manufacturers) gain access to a wider market for bulk orders, streamline their operations, and manage large-scale catering requests efficiently.

Bulk Food Buyers benefit from a curated selection of vendors, competitive pricing, simplified ordering processes for large quantities, and reliable delivery.

GigaEats aims to be the leading platform for "giga" scale food requirements, emphasizing reliability, variety, and technological sophistication. The platform will generate revenue primarily through a 7% transaction fee levied on food vendors for successful orders.
