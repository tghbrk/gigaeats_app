  - `system/` - system settings and audit screens
  - `reports/` - analytics and reporting screens

**→ orders/presentation/screens/admin/**
- `admin_orders_screen.dart` → New directory creation needed

## 🗂️ New Directory Structure Required

### Feature Directories to Create:
```
lib/src/features/
├── user_management/presentation/screens/
│   ├── customer/
│   ├── vendor/
│   ├── driver/
│   ├── sales_agent/
│   └── admin/
├── orders/presentation/screens/
│   ├── driver/
│   ├── sales_agent/
│   └── admin/
├── menu/presentation/screens/
│   └── (already has customer/, vendor/, sales_agent/)
├── marketplace_wallet/presentation/screens/
│   └── customer/
├── customer_support/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── domain/
│   └── presentation/
└── admin/presentation/screens/
    ├── user_management/
    ├── fleet_management/
    ├── system/
    └── reports/
```

## 📋 Migration Batch Strategy

### Batch 1: Customer Directory (21 screens)
- Highest complexity due to multiple feature touchpoints
- Create new directories in user_management, marketplace_wallet
- Create new customer_support feature

### Batch 2: Vendor Directory (10 screens)  
- Medium complexity
- Primarily user_management and menu features

### Batch 3: Driver Directory (10 screens)
- Medium complexity
- Primarily drivers feature with some user_management

### Batch 4: Sales Agent & Admin (18 screens)
- Lower complexity for sales_agent (7 screens)
- Admin reorganization (11 screens)

### Batch 5: Cleanup & Verification
- Remove empty directories
- Fix import paths
- Comprehensive testing

## 🔍 Import Dependency Analysis

### High-Impact Import Updates Needed:
1. **Routing Configuration** - All screen paths will change
2. **Provider Dependencies** - Cross-feature provider imports
3. **Widget Imports** - Shared widget consolidation
4. **Data Layer Imports** - Repository and service consolidation

### Critical Files to Update:
- `lib/src/core/router/app_router.dart` - All route definitions
- Provider files across all features
- Widget import statements
- Test files referencing moved components

## ⚠️ Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas:
1. **Routing Breakage** - Screen path changes affect navigation
2. **Provider Dependencies** - Cross-feature provider relationships
3. **Widget Import Chains** - Complex widget dependency trees

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Incremental Testing** - Test after each batch migration
2. **Import Path Tracking** - Document all import changes
3. **Rollback Preparation** - Git checkpoints before each batch
4. **Android Emulator Verification** - Test all user flows

## ✅ Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics:
- **0 broken imports** after migration
- **100% screen accessibility** from navigation
- **All user flows functional** on Android emulator
- **Clean directory structure** with no empty role-based folders

### Qualitative Metrics:
- **Feature-first organization** achieved
- **Logical component grouping** by functionality
- **Improved maintainability** and scalability
- **Consistent architecture patterns** across features
