# Wallet Payment Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented for wallet payment processing in the GigaEats application to prevent unauthorized transactions and ensure data integrity.

## Security Layers

### 1. Client-Side Pre-Validation (CustomerOrderService)

**Location**: `lib/src/features/orders/data/services/customer/customer_order_service.dart`

#### Pre-Validation Checks
- **Service Availability**: Validates wallet service is operational
- **User Authentication**: Verifies user is logged in and session is valid
- **Order Ownership**: Ensures user owns the order being paid for
- **Order Status**: Confirms order is in pending state (not already paid/cancelled)
- **Amount Validation**: Matches payment amount to order total (±0.01 tolerance)
- **Currency Validation**: Enforces MYR-only payments
- **Security Limits**: Min RM 0.01, Max RM 10,000 per transaction

#### Additional Security Validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Max 5 payment attempts per 5 minutes per user
- **Order Age Validation**: Orders older than 30 minutes cannot be paid
- **Session Freshness**: Sessions older than 24 hours require re-authentication
- **Large Transaction Validation**: Transactions >RM 500 require transaction history verification
- **Wallet Balance Freshness**: Forces balance refresh if older than 10 minutes

### 2. Edge Function Security (Supabase)

**Location**: `supabase/functions/secure-wallet-operations/index.ts`

#### Enhanced Security Validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Server-side verification of payment attempts
- **Amount Validation**: Strict validation of transaction amounts (>0, ≤RM 10,000)
- **Metadata Validation**: Ensures complete transaction data
- **Currency Validation**: Server-side MYR enforcement
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious transaction patterns
- **Wallet Ownership**: Validates user owns the wallet via RPC function

#### Suspicious Pattern Detection
- **Multiple Large Transactions**: >3 transactions ≥RM 1,000 in 24 hours
- **Rapid Transactions**: >3 transactions in 10 minutes
- **Unusual Amounts**: Transactions outside normal user patterns

### 3. Database Security (PostgreSQL + RLS)

**Location**: `supabase/migrations/20250703150220_add_security_validation_tables.sql`

#### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- **Wallet Access**: Users can only access their own wallets
- **Payment Attempts**: Users can only view their own payment attempts
- **Security Audit Logs**: Only admins can view security logs
- **Transaction History**: Users can only see their own transactions

#### Security Functions
- `validate_wallet_ownership()`: Verifies wallet ownership
- `check_daily_transaction_limit()`: Enforces RM 5,000 daily limit
- `detect_suspicious_pattern()`: Identifies suspicious transaction patterns
- `cleanup_old_security_logs()`: Maintains audit log hygiene

### 4. Audit Trail & Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
All security events are logged with:
- **Event Type**: Classification of security event
- **User ID**: User involved in the event
- **Event Data**: Detailed context and metadata
- **Severity**: Info, Warning, Error, Critical
- **Timestamp**: Precise timing of events

#### Payment Attempt Tracking
All payment attempts are logged with:
- **User ID**: Who attempted the payment
- **Order ID**: Which order was being paid
- **Payment Method**: Type of payment attempted
- **Status**: Attempted, Succeeded, Failed
- **Error Code**: Specific failure reason
- **Timestamp**: When the attempt occurred

## Error Handling & User Experience

### Error Categorization
- **Network Errors**: Retry guidance with connectivity tips
- **Insufficient Balance**: Direct link to wallet top-up
- **Authentication Errors**: Re-login guidance
- **Rate Limiting**: Wait time guidance
- **Server Errors**: Retry recommendations
- **Validation Errors**: Refresh page guidance

### User-Friendly Error Dialog
- **Visual Feedback**: Icons and color-coded error types
- **Actionable Buttons**: "Top Up Wallet", "Try Again", "Use Card Instead"
- **Auto-Navigation**: Direct to wallet screen for insufficient balance
- **Clear Guidance**: Step-by-step resolution instructions

## Security Monitoring

### Real-Time Alerts
- Rate limit exceeded events
- Large transaction attempts
- Suspicious pattern detection
- Authentication failures
- Wallet access violations

### Audit Reports
- Daily transaction summaries
- Security event analysis
- Pattern detection reports
- User behavior analytics

## Compliance & Standards

### Data Protection
- **PCI DSS**: No sensitive payment data stored locally
- **GDPR**: User consent and data minimization
- **Personal Data**: Encrypted and access-controlled

### Financial Regulations
- **Daily Limits**: RM 5,000 per user per day
- **Transaction Limits**: RM 10,000 per transaction
- **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history
- **Fraud Prevention**: Multi-layer validation

## Implementation Status

✅ **Client-Side Validation**: Complete with comprehensive pre-checks
✅ **Edge Function Security**: Enhanced with pattern detection
✅ **Database Security**: RLS policies and security functions
✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging and monitoring
✅ **Error Handling**: User-friendly with actionable guidance
✅ **Testing**: Ready for Android emulator validation

## Next Steps

1. **Apply Database Migration**: Run the security validation tables migration
2. **Test Security Flows**: Validate all security checks with Android emulator
3. **Monitor Security Events**: Review audit logs for any issues
4. **Performance Testing**: Ensure security checks don't impact performance
5. **User Training**: Document security features for support team
