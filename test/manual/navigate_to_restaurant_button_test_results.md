### ✅ Issue 2: Inconsistent User Experience
**Problem**: Different responses from identical actions
**Solution**: Standardized functionality across both implementations
**Result**: Identical user experience regardless of button location

### ✅ Issue 3: Limited Debug Visibility
**Problem**: Difficult to debug issues in Order Details Screen
**Solution**: Added comprehensive debug logging with visual indicators
**Result**: Complete visibility into status transitions and navigation actions

### ✅ Issue 4: Inconsistent Error Handling
**Problem**: Basic error handling in Order Details Screen
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling with specific messages
**Result**: Clear, actionable error feedback for users
